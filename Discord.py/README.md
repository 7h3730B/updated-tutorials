## Preparation
Make sure you have the newest Version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

#### 1. Create the Project and install all Dependencies
Open your terminal in the folder you want to store the bot in.
``` BASH
# Check if python is installed
python --version
# Create main.py file
# Install the discord.py Package
pip install discord
```
#### 2. Get the Bot token
Now get your token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and save it in your Clipboard. We will need it later for the Bot.
